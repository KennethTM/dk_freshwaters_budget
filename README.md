## Estimating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from Danish freshwaters

This project contains scripts and data used to estimate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from danish lakes and streams. CO<sub>2</sub> is estimated from national monitoring data on alkalinity, pH and water temperature. Gas transfer velocity is estimated from wind speed/surface area and flow velocity/slope for lakes and streams respectively. Emissions are upscaled using from surface areas of the different lake and stream size classes. Extraction and exploration of groundwater data is also included. All data used in the analysis are publicly available. Large data files are not included in this repository. The analysis and figures have are discussed in a popular science article in danish (Vand & Jord).
